        <h3> Writeup on medeco security features</h3>
        <p> Medeco has many different security features that you will encounter. First is the sheer line. This is affected by the pin heights and sizes but also on the generation. As you move away from classic and biaxial locks, the tolerances become much tighter. This results in later generations or the assa abloy stamped locks in being more difficult to pick. You will notice that many locks with higher tolerances are in higher lpu belt raitings as it is much harder to manipulate.</p>
        <p>The sidebar comes in two primary flavors for non-bilevel locks. First is the triangle esque wedge design. This is on most m series medecos. The keypins have a true gate with a length that matches with sidebar. When the sidebar wedge meets the key pin true gate the sidebar will retract into the lock allowing rotation. The directions are in 20 degree sets, left/center/right being 20 degrees from each other. The key pins feature this true gate that fits the sidebar. There are also serations and false gates that can prevent you from setting the sidebar as well. The fasle gates are easy, in my opinion, to move into and out of with little resistance. The serations are deep and can mess up the sheer line setting, mostly. You can set the sidebar to a seration by accident on worn down medeco locks.</p>
        <p>In addition to these features, MEDECO has introduced a few othes. The MEDECO3 or M3 series has a slider Mechanical piece that will prevent you from setting the sidebar. If you are picking clockwise, it will be the last thing you set after reaching the deep false set. If you are picking counter clockwise, it will set when the rotations are set to sidebar. It provides little added security in my opinion as opposed to the next security feature.</p>
        <p>The MEDECO4 or M4 series introduced side pins that prevent the sidebar from retracting. The M4 typically features 3 or 4 of these side pins. One will always be a interactive element denoted on the key with a small steel "ball" or cylinder. This side pin has no false gate. The other pins are set at one of four heights and contain one or more false gates.  More information will follow with photographs once I collect more information.</p>
        <p>The X4 or MEDECO Keymark X4 contains a check pin. This pin will restrict rotation if it not set. The one unique aspect about this check pin is that it can be overset. The simplist way I have found to set it correctly is taking a short end of a Z bar style tensioner and using it to hold the pin in place while also using bottom of the keyway tension off of it. Make sure your Z bar isn't too long by viewing the check pin through the port on the top of the kik or mortise. Sorry for those picking them inside padlocks and lfic/sfic bodies.</p>

            <h3>How to pick standard medecos, KIK and cylinder style. </h3>
            </p>
            <p> My favorite way to manipulate the pins has to do with the angles of the design. The original has V shaped key pins which are centered, meaning you can put a little pressure on either forward or aft of the pin and get rotations. The biaxial are offset, meaning that any lock from Biaxial to M4 will have pins facing you or away from you. I prefer to handle Bixaial keypins by pushing/pulling on either corner (left or right corner) as this rotates the pins easily. You can also pull with the lift using this method leading to even more rotation in corroded or damaged keyways.

            </p>
            <p> Picking medecos are not as complicated as some may lead you to believe. It all comes down to moving the pins in two ways, fowards/backwards and up/down. Any normal lock will be picked by setting the keypins at the sheer line (also known as picking to sheer). As you become more familiar with security pins, you will need to learn more techniques such as setting spools and barrels.</p>
            <p> Medecos add to this a new piece of the puzzel, the side bar. The only way for that sidebar to be allowed to move is to have the keypins set to the true gates. This allows the sidebar to retract into the core of the lock and rotation to happen. So, lets talk a bit on how this happens.</p>
            <p> For a great resource, see Lockfall Labs video on the resource tab.</p>

            <div className='cardish'>
              <p>The best way to set the keypins to the sidebar is to rotate the pin. This can be achieved rather simply by lifting the pin while pulling at a corner of the pin. You can also push and pull them without lifting for some rotation as well, but it is harder to control. Thankfully, medecos come with a rotational limiter.</p>
              <p>In case you didn't know, the rotation of a medeco keypin is locked to 20 degrees (unlike emhart pins which have free rotation). You can rotate the pins to the 20 degrees set by the key pin rather simply by pulling/pushing on corners with max force and it will always stop at the max of 20 degrees. They will also never be unable to be set by the key, unlike some other spinny pin locks.</p>
              <p>Lifting and rotating is also another option. While you lift the pin, pull or push on the corners to rotate the pin and hopefully set it. for those 0 degree pins, this can also be achieved with lift/rotation by pushing or pulling in the center of the pin during lifting. I find that this is the simplist way to achieve rotating.</p>
              <p> But wait! I got a false set! What do I do? Don't fret, it's easy to fix the mistake. False sets usually only will happen if a M3 security slider pin hasn't been pushed in, or you are picking clockwise and one of your key pins is in a false gate. Simply put max tension on the core and look for a pin that doesn't bounce. To fix, push or pull that stiff pin to put it into the true gate. Even using medium tension and pushing it to sheer works in most cases. </p>

          <h2> Progressive Picking is a must!</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you are into high security lock picking, you will have to learn to progressive pick. This involves removing whole pin stacks from the lock giving you a simple challenge without the full weight of the lock causing issues. I recommend starting with pins 3 and 4 only in the lock. Rotate them back and forth, lift to sheer, set them perfectly and test them out. By doing this, you understand how the whole lock will react as you pick it. Add one stack at a time, opening it over and over again to gain comfort and confedence in picking Medecos!
        </p>
        <p> the Other fun thing you can do is place only keypins in the lock with the sidebar. This allows you to learn the true gates of a medeco without having to worry about the sheer line. You can still overset pins, so focus on rotating pins with this setup. </p>
        <p> The other thing you will need to learn is the Clicky test. See the Resoruce tab for a video on the clicky test.</p>

          <h3> Medeco Cam lock Picking theory</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          First difference between the standard locks and the cam lock is the number of pins. Inside of these cam locks is single pins in each chamber. The cam lock sidebar is similar to the medeco sidebar except it is pointed rather than a channel. This means the cam pin contains a single hole and the sidebar fits into it in only one direction just like all other medecos. However, it is common for these cam pins to have serations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to pick these is medium tension and looking for those binding pins, like nomal. Lift and spin that binding pin until you feel it "lock" into the sidebar. It will feel solid and unable to be manipulated when it is set to sidebar.
